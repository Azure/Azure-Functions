# Azure Functions

Azure Functions is an event driven, compute-on-demand experience that extends the existing Azure application platform with capabilities to implement code triggered by events occurring in virtually any Azure or 3rd party service as well as on-premises systems. Azure Functions allows developers to take action by connecting to data sources or messaging solutions, thus making it easy to process and react to events. Azure Functions scale based on demand and you pay only for the resources you consume.

This repository acts as a directory for folks looking for the various resources we have for Azure Functions.

## Get Started with Azure Functions

To get started with Azure Functions, you can visit [functions.azure.com](https://functions.azure.com) and click on the green Get Started button. If you need a trial Azure subscription, there is also a link on that page.

## Documentation

Visit azure.com for the primary [Azure Functions documentation page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/functions-overview/).

If you would like documentation on the Functions runtime oriented towards contributors, those are hosted in the [Azure WebJobs SDK script GitHub wiki](https://github.com/azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/wiki).
