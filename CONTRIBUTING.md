# Contributing to Azure Functions

Azure Functions welcomes contributions and suggestions. One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes or documentation updates. If you have any questions, please ask a project maintainer.

Not all repositories related to Azure Functions adhere to the processes discussed in this guide. In interacting with any repository, it is suggested that you confirm the specific contribution guidelines and process for that repo. This guide covers the baseline standards for most repositories managed by the Azure Functions team.

## Code of conduct

Azure Functions projects have adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).  For more information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Reporting issues

For non-security related bugs, please log an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository. If you're not sure which repository to go to or have a general issue, please log an issue on the [Azure/Azure-Functions issue tracker](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Functions/issues).

### Reporting security issues and bugs
Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC): secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).

### Label glossary

A common set of labels, described in this section, are used across repositories managed by the Azure Functions team. A given repository may use additional issues. Be sure to check that repository's contribution guide or ask a maintainer if you have any questions.

### Milestone glossary

A common set of milestones, described in this section, are used across repositories managed by the Azure Functions team. A given repository may use additional milestones. Be sure to check that repository's contribution guide or ask a maintainer if you have any questions.

| Milestone                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Submitting a pull request

Azure Functions welcomes pull requests. However, we ask that if you wish to address an issue tracked in one of our repositories that is not flagged with the `help-wanted` label, please check in with the maintainers to make sure work is not already in progress.

Your pull request will now go through extensive checks by the project maintainers. Please be patient; the team operates a number of repositories and is often busy with their own contributions and service maintenance. We will try to get to your pull request as soon as we can. Please note that you may be asked to rebase or target a different branch as part of the review process, especially if other changes have been merged which would create a conflict.

The general flow for making a change to an Azure Functions repository is:
1. üç¥ Fork the repo (add the fork via `git remote add me <clone url here>`
2. üå≥ Create a branch for your change (generally use dev) (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. üõ† Make your change
4. ‚úîÔ∏è Test your changes
5. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Push your changes to your fork (`git push me my-change`)
6. üíå Open a PR to the dev branch
7. üì¢ Address feedback and make sure tests pass (yes even if it's an "unrelated" test failure)
8. üì¶ [Squash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your changes into a meaningful commits (usually 1 commit) (`git rebase -i HEAD~N` where `N` is commits you want to squash)
9. :shipit: Rebase and merge (This will be done for you if you don't have contributor access)
10. ‚úÇÔ∏è Delete your branch (optional)

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant the project the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com. When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. This needs to only be done once for any .NET Foundation OSS project.

Some repositories, such as [Azure/azure-functions-host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host) include an automated integration test suite. This will only be run when a project maintainer has provided initial review and may involve your changes being moved to a test branch. It is encouraged that you set up an environment to test these yourself before submitting.

If you have any questions about the process, please ask the project maintainers.

## Creating documentation and samples

There are a variety of ways you can contribute to Functions content. In addition to those discussed in this section, updates to repository readmes, wikis, or code comments are always welcome.

The primary Functions documentation on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) is open source on [MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs). You can learn more about contributing to the docs at the repo or by following the [Microsoft Docs Contributor Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/contribute/). 

The [Serverless Community Library](https://serverlesslibrary.net) is a catalog of community samples that can be deployed right away. You can submit a sample to the library by following the [Serverless Library contribution guide](https://github.com/Azure/ServerlessLibrary#how-to-contribute-to-the-serverless-library). In addition to samples, most client experiences for creating functions make use of a function template. The [templates repository](Azure/azure-functions-templates) defines templates for each supported trigger and language, as well as core sample scenarios.

## Azure Functions repositories

Azure Functions is built on work from the following repositories:
